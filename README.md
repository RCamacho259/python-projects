Project Description
The Automated File Organization project leverages AWS Lambda to automatically categorize and organize files uploaded to an S3 bucket. This automation reduces manual effort, ensuring files are consistently organized based on defined rules such as file type, upload date, and custom metadata.

Architecture
S3 Bucket: Stores the files that need to be organized.
AWS Lambda: Contains the Python script that processes and organizes the files.
S3 Event Notification: Triggers the Lambda function upon file upload.
AWS CloudWatch: Monitors and logs the Lambda function's performance and errors.
Setup and Deployment
Prerequisites
AWS account
Basic knowledge of AWS services (S3, Lambda, CloudWatch)
Python 3.x installed locally
Steps
Create S3 Bucket:

Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket.
Enable event notifications for the bucket to trigger the Lambda function on object creation.
Develop Lambda Function:

Write the Python script (lambda_function.py) to categorize and move files based on defined criteria.
Ensure the script handles errors and logs details to CloudWatch.
Create Lambda Function:

Navigate to AWS Lambda in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new Lambda function and upload the lambda_function.py script.
Configure the function's execution role to have permissions for S3 and CloudWatch.
Set Up S3 Trigger:

In the Lambda function configuration, add an S3 trigger pointing to the bucket created in step 1.
Set the event type to "All object create events."
Test and Optimize:

Upload test files to the S3 bucket and verify they are organized correctly.
Monitor the Lambda function via CloudWatch logs and optimize the script as needed.
Example Python Script (lambda_function.py)
python
Copy code
import json
import boto3
import os

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket_name = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        
        # Define categorization logic here
        if key.endswith('.jpg') or key.endswith('.png'):
            folder = 'images/'
        elif key.endswith('.pdf'):
            folder = 'documents/'
        else:
            folder = 'others/'
        
        new_key = folder + os.path.basename(key)
        
        # Move the file to the new location
        copy_source = {'Bucket': bucket_name, 'Key': key}
        s3_client.copy_object(CopySource=copy_source, Bucket=bucket_name, Key=new_key)
        s3_client.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key)
        
        print(f'Moved {key} to {new_key}')
Usage
Upload files to the S3 bucket.
The Lambda function will be triggered automatically.
Files will be organized into folders based on the defined logic (e.g., images/, documents/, others/).
Technologies Used
AWS Lambda: For executing the file organization logic.
Amazon S3: For storing and organizing files.
Python: Programming language for writing the Lambda function.
AWS CloudWatch: For logging and monitoring the Lambda function.
